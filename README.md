## 3-in-1 Console (Stopwatch, Counter, and Flappy Bird)
##### TLDR; On power up, the console should direct the user to the menu screen, where they can turn the knob to vary between the three modes and select the mode by clicking the rotary encoder.

#### 11/3/22 - The current breadboard prototype is wired with an LCD screen, push button, and power on/off switch. It successfully runs with a sample timer code. Due to complications and limitations of an LCD screen, we have placed an order for an OLED screen and will utilize that as soon as we receive it in about two business days (thank goodness for Amazon Prime).
